# d3-scale

Scales map a dimension of abstract data to a visual representation. Although most often used for encoding data as position, say to map time and temperature to a horizontal and vertical position in a scatterplot, scales can represent virtually any visual encoding, such as color, stroke width, or symbol size. Scales can also be used with virtually any type of data, such as named categorical data or discrete data that requires sensible breaks.
