# d3-selection

Selections allow powerful data-driven transformation of the document object model (DOM): set [attributes](./d3-selection/modifying.md#selection_attr), [styles](./d3-selection/modifying.md#selection_style), [properties](./d3-selection/modifying.md#selection_property), [HTML](./d3-selection/modifying.md#selection_html) or [text](./d3-selection/modifying.md#selection_text) content, and more. Using the [data join](./d3-selection/joining.md)â€™s [enter](./d3-selection/joining.md#selection_enter) and [exit](./d3-selection/joining.md#selection_enter) selections, you can also [add](./d3-selection/modifying.md#selection_append) or [remove](./d3-selection/modifying.md#selection_remove) elements to correspond to data.
